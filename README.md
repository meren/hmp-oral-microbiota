===================

We recently published a study in which we analyzed the human oral microbiome data generated by the HMP project. The paper is available online:

http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/E2875

This repository contains two R scripts and some data files we used to generate results in the paper:

- [analysis-of-differential-abudance.R](https://github.com/meren/hmp-oral-microbiota/blob/master/analysis-of-differential-abudance.R): This script identifies the site preference of an oligotype in the human oral cavity and reports its significance. Please read the __Calculation of Site Preferences__ section under [Material and Methods](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/E2875.full#sec-18) in our manuscript.
- [generate-figures.R](https://github.com/meren/hmp-oral-microbiota/blob/master/generate-figures.R): We used these functions to generate Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the manuscript. If you simply run it, the script will generate three example figures.
- v1v3 and v3v5 directories contain data files that are used either of these scripts.
